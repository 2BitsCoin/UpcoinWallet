# Security

During registration, the most important information is the wallet seed.

Save it somewhere save, you can also write it down on a piece of paper.

This seed will get AES encrypted with a password you insert and you can unlock it to access your account on login.

Every transaction will get signed locally with JavaScript and transmitted to the node without revealing your wallet seed or private keys.
